    Welcome.
    In this survey  you will be asked 16 questions.
    In each question you have to choose between two options: receive a certain amount of money at one point in time, or a different amount of money at another point in time.
    At the end of the experiment there will be a random lottery which decides one winner whose reward depends on her/his answers.
    All the answers are recorded.
    This game is completely anonymous.
