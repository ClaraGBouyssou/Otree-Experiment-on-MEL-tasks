    In the following survey you are going to make 16 choices in which at first you will receive an endowment
        then you need to decide if you want to lose
        a part of your endowment at one point in time,
    or a different amount at another point in time.
    The decisions you make are recorded.
    At the end of the experiment a respondent
    will be chosen at random and for her/him only one of the sixteen choices will be paid. This respondent will receive
    the difference between the endowment and the lose at the corresponding point in time.

        <i>For example:
        Imagine in the first choice you make you have an endowment of 20 euros and you decide to lose 10 euros in four weeks.
            If you are randomly selected and the first question of the 16
        is also randomly selected;  you will receive 10 euros in 4 weeks from the moment you submit your answers.</i> <br>
